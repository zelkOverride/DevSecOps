# What is DevSecOps 
DevSecOps focuses on security automation, testing and enforcement during DevOps - Release - SDLC cycles. The whole meaning behind this methodology is connecting together Development, Security and Operations. DevSecOps is methodology providing diffeent methods, techniess and processes backed mainly with tooling focusing on developer / secuirty experience. 

DevSecOps takes care that security is part of every stage of DevOps loop - Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor.

# Tooling

## Pre-commit time tools

In this section you can find lifecycle helpers, precommit hook tools and threat modeling tools. Threat modeling tools are specific category by themselves allowing you simulate and dicover potential gaps before you start to develop the software or during the process.

Modern DevSecOps tools allow to use Threat modeling as code or generation of threat models based on the existing code annotations.

## OSS and Dependecy management

Dependecny security testing and analysis is very important part of disocvering supply chain attacks. SBOM creation and following depenceny scanning (Software composition analysis) is critical part of Continuous integration. Data series and data trends tracking should be part of CI tooling. You need to know what you produce and what you consume in context of libraries and packages.

## SAST

Static code review tools working with source code and looking for known patterns and relationships of methods, variables, classes and libriaries. SAST works with the raw code and usualy not with build packages.

## DAST

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a type of application testing (in most cases web) that checks your application from the outside by active communication and analysis of the responses based on injected inputs. DAST tools rely on inputs and outputs to operate. A DAST tool uses these to check for security problems while the software is actually running and is actively deploed on the server (or serverless function).

## Policy as code

Policy as code is the idea of writing code in a high-level language to manage and automate policies. By representing policies as code in text files, proven software development best practices can be adopted such as version control, automated testing, and automated deployment.
